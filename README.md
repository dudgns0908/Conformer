# Introduction
This is an ASR model called **Conformer** made by Google. <br />
This paper introduces only encoder models. However, I implemented both this model encoder and decoder model using PyTorch.

Encoder was implemented as conformer according to the paper, and decoder was implemented as 'LSTM'.
